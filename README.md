# LK-Stuffable-Rimdark-gear
Lets you make Power Armors in RimDark out of any metallic materials you have in your game PLUS original cost of the armor itself.

If Vanilla Expanded Framework is in stalled all PowerArmors get a shield bubble similar to VAE's ranged shield belt but made to fit Power armors better.
